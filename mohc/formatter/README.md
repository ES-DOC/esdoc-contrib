# Metadata formatter

The metadata formatter produces metadata documents based on templates
by querying your underlying metadata stores. It uses
[pyesdoc](https://github.com/ES-DOC/esdoc-py-client) to build the
document in memory and convert it to the output format you request.

## Documentation and support

Documentation is included in the form of a web page in the `doc`
directory.

Support is provided to modelling centres on a best efforts basis.
