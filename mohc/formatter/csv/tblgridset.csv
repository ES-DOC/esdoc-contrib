"1","1","UM ATM N96L38 Grid","Unified Model 192-column 38-level Atmosphere Grid Set","The key features of the N96L38 atmosphere grid are as follows:

The grid is logically rectangular and dimensioned (i=192, j=145, k=38), where i = longitude, j = latitude, k = level. Horizontal grid cell size is 1.875 degrees in longitude by 1.25 degrees in latitude. Vertical levels are terrain-following for levels up to k=29 and constant thickness above that level. Grid staggering (i.e. between the sub-grids used by scalar (physics) and vector quantities) is based upon the Arakawa-C grid configuration.

Array indexing in the latitude direction starts at the south pole. For an unrotated grid mesh, longitude (i=0.5) corresponds to Greenwich meridian.

In the Unified Model, the north and south poles coincide with the bounding half-integer j planes, i.e. j=0.5 and j=M-0.5. P-points and u-points exist at the poles, but not v-points. At the poles all values of P variables are set equal. Likewise for scalar variables rho, theta, m and w."
"1","2","UM OCN N180L40 Grid","Unified Model 360-column 40-level Ocean Grid Set","The key features of the N180L40 ocean grid are as follows:

The grid is logically rectangular and dimensioned (i=360, j=216, k=40), where i = longitude, j = latitude, k = depth. The grid is characterised as regular rather than uniform since the Y dimension (latitude) is specified via a 1D vector rather than a constant scalar offset.

Between the poles and 30 degrees N and S the horizontal grid cell size is 1.0 degree by 1.0 degree. In the tropical region, however, the grid cell size in the Y/latitude direction decreases (and resolution increases) smoothly from 1 degree at 30 N/S to approximately 1/3 degree at the equator.

Grid staggering in the ocean grid is based upon the Arakawa-B grid scheme. In this scheme, u and v variables are co-located at the corners points of the grid cells. T and w variables coincide in the horizontal (at the grid cell centres) but are offset from each other by one-half a grid cell in the vertical. In physical space, T/w points are exactly halfway in latitude between u/v points, but the converse does not hold true. In the vertical, T points are exactly halfway in depth between w points, but again the converse does not hold true.

The bottom surface of the ocean grid is at depth 5500 metres."
