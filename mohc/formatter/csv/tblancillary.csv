"30","well_mixed_gas_CO2","atmospheric concentrations of CO2 expressed in units of mass mixing ratio (mmr) with units of kg/kg - the factor used to convert concentrations provided by CMIP5 in ppmv  to mmr units was (44.0/28.964e6)"
"34","crop_pasture","annual fractional cover of crop/pasture - the historical land use data is based on the HYDE database v3.1 (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2010a; Klein Goldewijk et al., 2010b) as processed for CMIP5 by Hurtt et al (2010), and made available at 0.5 x 0.5 degree resolution with annual increments - the disturbed fraction is re-gridded onto the N96 grid using area average re-gridding"
"26","land_use","The historical land use data is based on the HYDE database v3.1 (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2010a; Klein Goldewijk et al., 2010b) as processed for CMIP5 by Hurtt et al (2010), and made available at 0.5 x 0.5 degree resolution - these fractions are mapped on to the N96 grid using area average re-gridding"

"31","well_mixed_gas_ozone","3D gridded data of stratospheric ozone interpolated to the grids of the model using the file (17 levels for HadCM3)"
"43","volcanic_optical_thickness","vertical profiles of optical thickness for four equal area latitudinal zones on a monthly timestep"
"28","solar","Annual mean variations in total solar irradiance (TSI) are partitioned across six shortwave spectral bands (0.2-10&#956;m) to estimate the associated spectral changes with TSI variations (Lean et al., 1995). With the changes across the spectral bands the Rayleigh scattering and ozone absorption properties are also varied. The TSI data used for the historic period were recommended by CMIP5 (Lean et al., 2009 -L09; SOLARIS 2009) and are created from reconstructions of solar cycle and background variations in TSI. The annual mean TSI was processed to force the mean of the 1700-2004 period to be the same as the model control solar constant value (1365 Wm-2). "
