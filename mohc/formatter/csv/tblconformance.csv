"204","42","20",,"input","Includes secondary organic aerosols from biogenic emissions.  All other natural aerosols are simulated interactively (ammonium sulphate, fossil-fuel black carbon, fossil-fuel organic carbon, biomass burning, sea-salt and mineral dust). Precursors include sulphur dioxide emissions, land DMS emissions and ocean DMS emissions."
